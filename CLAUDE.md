# Project Instructions

## Code Changes Policy
- Do NOT directly edit or write code in the codebase. Instead, provide detailed explanations of what needs to be changed and why, so the developer can implement it themselves.
- When identifying bugs or issues, explain the root cause, the fix, and where exactly it should be applied.
